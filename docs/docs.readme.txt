The muddle documentation and sphinx and ReadTheDocs
===================================================

Pre-built documentation
-----------------------
For your comfort and convenience, a pre-built version of the muddle
documentation is available at:

    http://muddle.readthedocs.org/

This is hosted by `Read the Docs`_, who are wonderful people for providing
such a facility. The documentation should get rebuilt on each push to the
repository, which means that it should always be up-to-date.

.. _`Read the Docs`: http://readthedocs.org

Building the documentation
--------------------------
The muddle documentation is built using Sphinx_.

.. note:: It needs (at least) version 0.6 of Sphinx, which is later than the
          version installed via apt-get on Ubuntu 8.10. The best way to
          upgrade is with easy_install, as described on the Sphinx website.

          You may also also need graphviz (which provides ``dot``).

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

As said above, the easiest way to get the documentation is via `Read the
Docs`_, but if you want to build a copy yourself, then all you need to do is
install Sphinx_, and use the Makefile::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

The Python bindings
-------------------
Read the muddle-package.txt file to see how individual classes and functions
within the muddled package are documented. Obviously, if you add, remove or
rename such, you may need to alter this file -- please do so appropriately.
