	* commands.py: There's a new 'muddle runin <labelspec> <command>' command
	to run a system command in every directory matching a labelspec. Useful
	for things like 'svn rebase'

	* commands.py: muddle commit, muddle update, muddle push now work on checkouts
	rather than packages. The previous commit, update and push have been
	fixed so that they always take package arguments and renamed
	pkg-commit, pkg-update, pkg-push

	* vcs/svn.py: Fixed issue 32.

	* Started this changelog.
