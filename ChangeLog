	* muddled/*.py: Docstrings are now all legal reStructuredText - this
	is the beginning of fixes for issue 33. The only other change to the
	Python files is to add full stops at the end of all docstring
	sentences.

	Note: I've maintained the muddle policy of putting the opening ``"""``
	of a docstring on a separate line. This actually matters in
	commands.py (see the comments therein).

2009-08-28  Richard Watts  <rrw@kynesim.co.uk>

	* commands.py: There's a new 'muddle runin <labelspec> <command>' command
	to run a system command in every directory matching a labelspec. Useful
	for things like 'svn rebase'

2009-08-28  Richard Watts  <rrw@kynesim.co.uk>

	* commands.py: muddle commit, muddle update, muddle push now work on checkouts
	rather than packages. The previous commit, update and push have been
	fixed so that they always take package arguments and renamed
	pkg-commit, pkg-update, pkg-push

	* vcs/svn.py: Fixed issue 32.

	* Started this changelog.
