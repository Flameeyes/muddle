Changes since muddle v2.4.4

* Lifecycle support. I've been working on this for a while. Basically, it
  allows branching a whole build tree for maintenance support.

  New commands are::

    muddle init -branch <branch> <repo> <build-desc>
    muddle branch-tree <new-branch>
    muddle query checkout-branches
    muddle query checkout-id
    muddle sync

  See the new lifecycle documentation (a new chapter in the normal muddle
  documentation), and also "muddle help" for each of the above.

* New squashfs and romfs deployments. Also, the underlying code for the
  "muddled.deployments" modules has been rewritten, and CPIO deployments can
  now be made to a package (specifically, to a package install directory),
  removing one of the causes of packages depending on deployments.

* A rewritten and more powerful "muddle doc" command. See "muddle help doc",
  and try::

     muddle doc Label
     muddle doc Label -pydoc
     muddle doc -contains Directory

* Minor tweaks in the release mechanism, based on experience of using it.
  These include adding a "-test" switch to "muddle release", and allowing
  "muddle stamp release" to "guess" the next version number to use for a
  release stamp.

   See "muddle help release" and "muddle help stamp release".

* A new "quickstart" section at the beginning of the documentation, for those
  who've just been given a build using muddle for the first time.

* The Invocation class is no more, it has been folded into Builder. Thus
  ``builder.invocation.XXX`` is now identical to ``builder.XXX`` in all cases.
  This basically makes build descriptions a bit simpler, and removes the
  problem of how to remember whether a particular method had ``.invocation``
  in front of its name or not.

* There has been an internal rewrite of the version control handler support
  and much of the "memory" of how checkouts work has been moved from there to
  the Database class and db.py. This was a prequisite of the lifecycle work.

* There have been various minor fixes in license support, including not
  propagating GPL licenses to/through GPL licenses.

* And a variety of other tidyings and bugfixes.
